## Background
This project explore VR technology in conjunction with game design to create a virtual escape room envrionment.
With over 1,900 escape rooms in the US in 2022 and even more globally, escape rooms have become a trend
and popular group activity. With the rise in popularity of VR, I have decided to create a virtual escape room.
With this escape room I hope to incorporate various, puzzles, games, and landscapes.
There is also a significant amount of VR technology being incorporated into schools,
so I would like to cater this room towards a younger audience in an educational manner.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an escape room through VR
technology. The goal would be to have a fully functional and interactive
room with puzzles and games to help the user get through the room. The
user would walk around through the room and solve each puzzle that would
allow them to eventually make it out of the room. I am looking into
possibly incorporating educational elements to the escape room.
These educational elements would include things like math, science, and
physics based puzzles.

The escape room itself would be built with a child audience in mind,
probably around late elementary, early middle school age.


## Data
Because this project is more focused on development rather than data, the "datasets" I am including in this project is assets that I will use for the project. For this project I plan on starting off with the base assets in the Unity escape room asset set, and if I need to, I will prepare/make more.


## Methods
To start off the project I will be completing Unity tutorials through Unity learn. Starting off with the basic Unity fundamentals and then going onto Unity VR tutorials. From then on I plan on creating the base room, and testing to make sure the user is able to move around and interact with items in the room. After that I will add puzzle functionality and test again. Then I will my own twists to the puzzles already included in the assets to create an educational environment. Finally, I will go back and make sure that everything works and then try and find a way to demo it during Furman engaged.


##Evaluation
The way I will know if my project is successful, is if it works seamlessly multiple times, and if it is actually possible to escape the room. I will also know the level of success if it works with someone around the age group I am targeting. For testing the escape room, I can ask around if I can try on elementary school class. For example, I could ask a GCS elementary school to try on kids around the age group I'm targeting and see if they can make it out of the room. If at least a majority are able to, I would consider it a success. I would also test to see if the teacher(s) think it could be something that would be a fun activity to incorporate in classes, as well as how much the kids enjoyed it.


##Dissemination
Ideally I would like to have either a live demo at Furman Engaged, or display a screen recording of the escape room. I would make the source code available publicly via GitHub.
