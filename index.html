<h1>This is my project page</h1>
<p>This project is meant to combine Virtual Reality technology with education. Through an interactive escape room I plan to create and fun and engaging way for students (around elementary/middle school age) to review concepts, learn something new, etc.</p>

<p>To create the escape room I am using the Unity game engine. The game is being created to be played on a MetaQuest VR headset.</p>
